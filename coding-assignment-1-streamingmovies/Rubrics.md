# Performance Descriptors
## Overview
The performance descriptors are split into two parts:

- **Technical:** These performance descriptors express how we grade our students concerning the technical requirements of this course
- **Habit and Behavior:** These performance descriptors express how we grade our students in terms of their social habit and behavior. They especially clarify how we expect that project work is done. Since project work is a good part of the assignments in the courses IF.03.01 Basic Web Technique 1 and IF.04.01 Basic Web Technique 2 these descriptors influence students’ score.
