      <h2>History of Amazon Prime Video</h2>
      <section>
        <p>On 21 February 2014 Amazon Prime was combined with the online video provider Lovefilm to the streaming platform Amazon instant video.<br/>
          In January 2015, Transparent became the first show produced by Amazon Studios to win a major award and the first series from a streaming video service to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy.<br/>
          In 2015, Amazon launched the Streaming Partners Program, a platform allowing subscription-based third-party channels and streaming services to be offered to Amazon Prime subscribers through the Amazon Video platform. These services are separate from the Amazon Video offering, and must be purchased separately.<br/>
          In September 2015 the word "Instant" was dropped from its title in the US, and it was renamed simply Amazon Video.<br/>
          Amazon announced in November 2016 that it planned to stream globally, which led to speculation over whether the full Amazon Video service would begin a wider international rollout to compete with Netflix. On December 14, 2016, Amazon Video expanded into 200 countries.<br/>
          In April 2017, Amazon began to make sports-related content acquisitions, first acquiring non-exclusive rights to stream portions of the NFL's Thursday Night Football games during the 2017 NFL season to Prime subscribers in a $50 million deal.</p>
